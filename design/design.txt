First World Game Dev problems: I have a beautifully tragic game idea, but I haven't had enough personal tragedy in my own life to be taken seriously.

It would be a short art game. The length of a song, tops

Press Any key To Live. The interaction is you just press any key to keep a heartbeat rhythm. If you mess up the rhythm the character dies before the story finishes.

So you get the rhythm right and watch this story unfold. It's some sad/tragic story that ends with the main character on their death bed in an empty hospital room.

Now you've put the player in a predicament, if the story was good enough. Nothing is changing in the story any more, you just hear the heartbeat monitor when you press a key. The main character isn't moving.

Music finishes, this is the end of the game. The only thing the player can do is stop playing by stop beating the heart and letting the character flatline.

but if I made such a game, people will ask: who was the inspiration for this game? Did you lose someone in this way?

And no, I haven't. Just making stuff up.
